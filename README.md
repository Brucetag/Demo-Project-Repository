# Files Inculded:

-PROG7312 POE: This is my solo project in which we were tasked with developing a hypothetical “municipal desktop application” for the Western Cape, in C#, using our choice of GUI framework. 

-XBCAD7319_ChariTech_Website: This was a group project, with three other classmates, to develop a usable webportal for a real local church in the claremont area, that would reach the needs and requirements set by the spokesperson of the church.

-“1000 KITTENS”: A hobby project of mine, coded in GMS2, for a game jam I did with friends where the topic or theme was randomly generated. The topic for this game jam just so had to be “1000 KITTENS” and thus we had to incorporate the concept into our game somehow.

-MoveMate-OPSC7312-Final-POE: A group project I did for university, which entailed that we make an android app in kotlin that would meet some requirements. We elected to develop our android app to be a fitness assistant, with build in google metric api integrations and workout tracking features.

-OPSC7311_-POE_Git: This was another group project in which we were tasked on developing a kotlin app that would assist in time management in corporate environments. My group managed to create our “TimeDivers” app, which included a GUI that was developed by me and several time and productivity related features, such as a proposed gamification eature between anonymous teams and task storing and reporting software.

-PROG6212POE: For this solo project, we had to develop a C# .Net framework GUI desktop application that would facilitate a hypothetical “Contract Monthly Claim System”, that would allow the processing of any claims put forward to a university administrative department by lecturers.
